Basic Description

The user selects a picture from his file-system and uploads it. On the click of a button a request is sent to
the API, and the view is changed to displaying the results sent back from the API.
Here the user can see what the API identified the image to be with the confidence interval.

Post-MVP:

The user can upload more than one picture, and can view them on the browser. When he clicks any,
the view is changed to what the picture is.
